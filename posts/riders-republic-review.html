                <p><u><b><a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-us/game/riders-republic" target="_blank">Riders Republic</a></b></u> is Ubisoft&#39;s new racing game that&#39;s free for the weekend. It&#39;s an open-world hub where you get to ride with other players on bikes, skis, flying wingsuits—you name it! This game is a fun and polished sports racer. If you are a fan of Trials Fusion and SNOW, you will enjoy this game.</p>

                <br />
                <h1>Gameplay</h1>
                <p>The gameplay is loads of fun. The variety of vehicles is refreshing and it is exciting to get to cruise through the world with other players. The graphics are very nice to look at and the UI is equally as visually pleasing.</p>
                <p>The game has the same level-up system you see in modern-day online games. You can customize your vehicles and character, so by playing matches, you earn XP for level-ups, which rewards you with random cosmetic drops.</p>
                <br />

                <h1>Wonky Moments</h1>
                <p>When you crash into something, there is a <i>backtrack</i> mechanic which sets you back a few meters before you crashed. Sometimes that means that you will be stuck just on the edge of the checkpoint&#8212;which you have to reverse to get into, turned the wrong way, or awkwardly waiting for the mechanic to play out. Mistakes are costly, and can set you back 10 spots on the leaderboard.</p>
                <p>Every 30 minutes, the game also hosts a 64-player race, called the <i>Mass Race</i> event. The beginning of these matches is pure chaos. Players are colliding into each other, everyone looks the same, and you can&#39;t tell where you are. It is like an army of orange rabbits being let out of the hutch. </p>

                <br />
                <br />
                <p>What could help is if at the beginning of the match, players were transparent and <br />non-collidable, and normal visibility could be restored once everyone was spread out. <br>I imagine that Ubisoft is working on this, so let&#39;s enjoy the madness while it lasts!</p>


                <p><b>Riders Republic</b> will be released for <u><a href="https://www.x-rates.com/table/?from=USD&amount=59.99" target="_blank">$59.99</a></u>, but is free for the weekend (Oct 21&#8211;Oct 27).  <br />You can find it on <a href="https://www.epicgames.com/store/en-US/p/riders-republic" target="_blank"><u>Epic Games</u></a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/riders-republic/" target="_blank"><u>PlayStation</u></a>, <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-ca/games/store/riders-republic/9pgcv2nvxchl/0010" target="_blank"><u>Xbox</u></a>, and the <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/riders-republic/9pgcv2nvxchl" target="_blank"><u>Microsoft Store</u></a>.</p>
