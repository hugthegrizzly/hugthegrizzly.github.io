                <p><u><b><a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-us/game/riders-republic" target="_blank">Riders Republic</a></b></u>  is a fun, open-world sports game. It has racing, trickshotting, and open-world exploration. It has an upbeat, energetic tone: 21st century summer mixed with 90s hip-hop vibes. There is a lot of wacky language like: &quot;rad,&quot; &quot;awesomeness,&quot; &quot;sick,&quot; and &quot;gnarly,&quot; along with record-rewind sound effects. There is a lot of humour in this game which doesn&#39;t take itself seriously. Its gameplay reminded me of Skate, SNOW and Trials Fusion. </p>

                <h1 class="heading">Gameplay</h1>
                <p>As you would expect, Riders Republic is all about racing and trickshots. You can race against other players at different locations across the map: snowy mountains, the rockies, the sky--you name it. The map is vast and full of different sights and biomes to explore. Outside of race events, you can interact with other players and cruise around the world in any vehicle of your choice. </p>
                <p>List of gamemodes: racing events (&amp; Mass Race), trick challenges, or simple open-world exploration (where you still get to ride around and do tricks). Every 30 minutes, there are also &quot;Mass Race&quot; events. These are matches where you get to race against up to 64 players. Here is the list of vehicles: bike, skis, snowboard, snowmobile, jetskis, rocketwing, wingsuit, jetcar (and others!). </p>
                <p>The game has a a typical level-up system you&#39;d find in modern online games, where playing matches gives you XP and levelling up gives you loot (gear, cosmetics, new events in the open-world). You also gain in-game currency which you can spend on cosmetics in the shop.</p>
                <p>The variety of locations, vehicles and cosmetics is actually fun and refreshing. Despite the variety of content, the gameplay loop is something you get used to pretty fast, so unless you&#39;re aiming for high scores or technical mastery, it would be more fun to play with friends. The game uses a lot of cinematics to tell you about the gameplay and environment; it can feel lengthy at times, but it is informative. For the beginner tutorial, the game introduces you to a few characters who guide you through the first stages. Warning: there are quite a lot of cinematics and humour. For someone who hasn&#39;t played a sports game before, the controls have a bit of a learning curve, but you&#39;ll get it with time and soon you&#39;ll be cruising through the skies (or lands). The trickiest to learn I found are the aerial vehicles (rocketwings and wingsuits).</p>

                <h1 class="heading">Art</h1>
                <p>Speaking of sound effects, both the sound design and visuals are satisfying. The UI looks nice and fresh, consistent with the tone of the game. The landscapes in the game look beautiful, and the sound effects of the vehicles, menu and environment are pleasant to listen to: bike wheels grazing across the dirt, the crunching of snow, the crinkling of tree branches. You can explore the open world with players online, and see different sights, biomes and try out different vehicles.</p>

                <br />
                <h1 class="heading">Wonky Moments</h1>
                <p>My least favourite, wonky parts of the game are how unforgiving making mistakes is and at times forced cinematics. I wish there&#39;d been more stylish cosmetics. Making mistakes can be very frustrating in this game. The game has a mechanic called &quot;backtrack&quot; which, when you crash, allows you to rewind your movement back to a more fitting position you were in before you crashed. It feels a bit awkward and can be really costly for your position in the race. It&#39;s difficult especially when the environment is so detailed and the tracks can blend in with the rest of the background, where you can easily go off-track (although the game tries its best to guide you). What&#39;s frustrating though is how inconvenient it can be to backtrack when your position always relies on your previous trajectory (never ideally in the center of the track; what caused you to crash in the first place), which puts you in really awkward spots. Add momentum on top, and you can sometimes backtrack and still miss the checkpoint, forcing you to backtrack once more, losing even more time. I wish you could maybe respawn at the center of the track, or instead have the backtrack compensate with a certain amount of sprint that&#39;ll allow you to catch up (if you can make use of it). Most of these inconveniences though would not be a problem with practice. Once you get the hang of it, you&#39;ll be more aware of how to avoid these mistakes, so they shouldn&#39;t be that much of a problem. That being said, even though the backtrack mechanic is undeniably stylish, I do wish it was a bit better optimized, to prevent players from being stuck in a loop of trying to get out of an awkward position on a track.</p>

                <div class="post-img"><img src="1-img-2.png" class="post-img" /></div>
                <p>I love the almost RPG-feel of getting to explore the open world and unlocking things, with different gear--in this case being bikes, snowmobiles, or your own weapon (vehicle) of choice. My favourite vehicles have got to be the jetskis. Doing a perfect, smooth run is the most satisfying thing with them. Gliding through the snow with boosters is euphoric. I feel that sports racing and open-world are a great, refreshing mix. It really is a joyride.</p>
                <p>The price of the game will be $59.99 (US). The game can be completed (by unlocking all there is) with about ~10 hours of playtime, is my prediction. But there is a lot of replayability potential for trying to grind for gear, complete challenges, nail trickshots and climb the leaderboard.</p>
                <p>Personally, I had fun playing the 4 hours that were available for the free trial, and feel fulfilled. I&#39;m already looking back at it and thinking, &quot;Dang, I want to do that again.&quot; It&#39;s still early to judge the game prior to release, but I wanted to share my impressions. I am sure there are things Ubisoft still plans to tweak. Thanks to Ubisoft for giving the opportunity for the community to try the game for free, and kudos to all of their work and effort. They did a great job. The art direction and branding of this game is my personal favourite thing about it! &quot;Radical!&quot;</p>
